# phaser3-template
A template I use for games made with Phaser 3

## How to install
1) Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2) Get the live server extension so you can test your  game

## How to use
1) All your assets are loaded in the `P` class in `main.js`, put it in the `preload` method & animations are created in `create`
2) The base main scene is in `MainScene.js` all game logic can go there, and you can add other scene files to the `scenes` folder
3) assets go in the `assets` directory
4) To test your game with live server, you can right click your index.html and select "Open with Live Server", any changes made to your code will be changed live in the game
5) have a blast!
